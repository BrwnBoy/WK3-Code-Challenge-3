## How to access the programs:

First copy the SSH key so that you can be able to clone the repository to you local machine. After cloning the repository to your machine cd into it so that we can be able to open it through our personal editors(VS code). From there; you can now begin to make your own personal tweaks in the programs.

*Happy Coding!*

### What's the programs contain:

These four pieces of code are what make up the entire program, here's what each of them contain:
**Index.html**: This where all the linking and small edits are done from.

**Style.css**: This is where all the editing/styling of the website are done, e.g; adding colour to something or change the font and size of the wording in the website.

**Index.js**: This is where all the interactivity is added through, e.g; the buttons in the website, the ticket distribution of the website and e.t.c.

**Db.json**: This is the server for website, these acts as the resource for the data that is found within the website which in this case is the movies, tickets and duration of the movies with their numberings.
